My name is Steven Fairchild and I have previous experience as a Linux/VMware systems administrator, Networking administrator, and training in Cyber Security. I had trouble selecting a project at first as I wanted something that included every aspect of software that we are learning how to use. I also want to select a project that will be interesting and applicable to the hiring managers I will be interviewing with. This will accomplish my personal objectives by incorporating all the learning objectives set forth by this course and show that I can implement them in a practical way. In doing so it will help me prove my skills as a developer that can incorporate many different technologies to work together. 

I've chosen to create a **help desk ticket system as my project.** This type of program will require authentication, authorization, and multiple user roles. These roles being the end users submitting help desk tickets, the IT employees viewing and responding to them, and an administrator role for the site. The application will require a web user interface, authentication, authorization, automation (reminders for waiting tickets, ticket creation confirmations), a database to store and retrieve information. The database will support creating tickets, updating tickets, reading, and deleting tickets by roles with the proper permissions. This type of system is usable in any industry, from IT help desk issues, to maintenance requests for renters, the possibilities are endless and in wide use today.

### <center> Data Phase</center>

The data contained within my help desk ticket system will include:

* User information
	* Such as contact information, name location, etc.
* Description of the problem
* An option to upload an image of the problem
* A location to reference a previous ticket, to allow for it to be associated with a reoccuring issues and view that information.
* Problem location
* Information only viewable by accounts with the appropraite role
	* An example is comments made by employees that an end user doesn't really need to know the details of.
* Groups/Ques by the end user.
	* If multiple departments used the same service for ticket tracking, you'd need them to be seperate from each other.
* Ticket statuses: Open, Awaiting review, in progress, closed, etc.
* The software will need to be hosted on a server, most likely this will be accomplished on a Microsoft Azure virtual machine later on.

### <center> Programming Phase</center>

I will need to make a schedule to help me follow a set workflow path. This schedule will outline project deadlines, and blocks set forth for when to work on what part of the project.
I will be using auth0 with ASP.NET for user authentication and authorization. SQL will be used as the database to store, read, update, and delete user information. I will attempt to use C# and ASP.NET for the core programming components, however as I learn more about ASP.NET I will see how applicable it is in relation to C# and this application. Auth0 also supports C# in UWP usage.

### <center> User Interface </center>

The user interface will have different menus depending on what permissions the user logged in has. A manager will have permissions to view all tickets within their scope, ticket responders will have access to new tickets in the ques, tickets they have taken ownership of, and any that involve group efforts. The end user will only be able to see the status of their own tickets, and any notes/comments that have been added to it, as well as past closed tickets. There will be a viewable record of all past tickets, open tickets, and anything in between for manager/administrator roles. I plan on including applicable graphs, pie charts, etc. where I can.

### <center> Action Plan </center>

I will need to make a schedule to help me follow a set workflow path. This schedule will outline project deadlines, and blocks set forth for when to work on what part of the project. I plan on ensuring all the software will work together, namely Auth0 as it is a third-party software being incorporated. I plan on working on each requirement individually to ensure each task is completed and I am not skipping around too much leaving things unfinished. I will likely do the testing on a virtual machine locally, then upon completion (or when I have access to Azure) deploy to an Azure virtual machine for production.
