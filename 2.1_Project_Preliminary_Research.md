My name is Steven Fairchild and I grew up in a suburb of Oklahoma City. I spent my last two years of high school also attending a technical college where I learned a great deal about computer hardware/software, networking, cyber security, etc. I competed nationally in Northrop Grumman's Cyber Patriot security competitions, as well as my school's state and national cyber security and networking competitions placing 3rd and 5th respectively. After graduating I spent a short time managing VMware and Linux servers, specifically Dell's PowerEdge and cloud line. I joined the United States Marine Corps to fulfill a personal duty I felt I needed to complete and am currently very excited to re-engage my passion for technology professionally.

My personal hobbies are managing my own DNS add blocking/filtering server, NFS server, and other miscellaneous projects. I typically use a Linux operating system exclusively on my personal computer but have since dual booted to be able to use native Microsoft software for this course. Outside of tech stuff I enjoy having pets of different types, currently a couple of aquariums, two budgies and a small silky terrier. In the future I have a few more animals I would like to get once I am in a more permanent living situation, but I do not want to take on too much. I like to fish and hunt when the weather and seasons are appropriate and shoot recreationally on a regular basis. When I have the time, I would like to get into USPSA and IDEPA shooting competitions. 

My personal objectives for this project are to learn what interests me about programming, and what type of applications/services I will enjoy working on. I anticipate learning much via trial and error throughout this project, as I am sure others would agree, I learn best by doing rather than reading/watching/seeing others do. I want to learn and become confident in C#, markdown, T-SQL, software development lifecycles, working with teams on projects, and any other languages I am introduced to as best as I can.
In short, I am very passionate about cyber technology and am very excited to venture into the developer side of the house.

## Project 1 - Database Graphical User Interface

The first project I am interested in would involve creating a graphical application for creating and managing a database. I know that these are in common use today, but from what I can think of the mechanics are hidden to the end user. Microsoft access comes to mind as an advanced and feature rich interface for Microsoft's Jet Database engine. Completing this project will help me to learn and understand the basics of creating a graphical user interface, accepting user input and displaying results, input validation, storing and searching data within a database, and become more familiar with SQL database's in general.

## Project 2 - Group Messaging Application

I know there are many group messaging systems in wide use today. GroupMe, Whatsapp, Discord, to name a few. Those are more private/small group messaging, on the public social media side there's Twitter and Snapchat that I believe also fall into this category.
I believe focusing on this project will help me to focus more so on the user experience, as well as the mechanics of making a messaging application function behind the scenes. I believe this would help me to become familiar with the software development cycle and bug fixing.

## Project 3 - Strategy Game

I am sure everyone has gotten excited about the thought of programming a video game at some point or another. I have never really wanted to create video games, but I am interested in giving a simple game a try. I know there are many text-based dungeons crawlers that are quite famous. I believe this project would help me to be more creative and flexible with what I create, how and why. I also think this project would probably have the most bugs to find and correct. It may have more parts to interconnect and make work together.

## Project 4 - IoT software

One of the examples was an ATM. I think I would like to try and develop software to work in an integrated, standalone system. Mostly because I have heard and read a lot of bad things about IoT devices from my experience with cyber security. I can see why this is the belief as the software is usually developed for these devices and never really maintained afterwards, depending on the popularity and internet connections available. With this knowledge I know that it is very important to work out any bugs, security flaws, issues at all before release time as there is limited or no chance to correct errors after the fact. Very similar to how software used to be before manufacters could just push out bug fixes after release.
I believe this would help my objectives of becoming familiar with programming languages, attention to detail, databases, and user interfaces.

### Conclusion
Regardless of which project I end up selecting, I will meet my goals becoming confident in C#, markdown, T-SQL, software development lifecycles, working with teams on projects, and any other languages I am introduced to as best as I can by spending many hours working on my academic work as well as this project. I have found that the best way to learn something new like this is to enjoy it and spend lots of time learning and perfecting my work. My academic studies and homework with Embry-Riddle and Microsoft will give me plenty of material to do this with, and it will be up to me to put the time and effort into accomplishing my goals.
